Hello and welcome to my little corner on the web! I created this site, in part, as a response to the quote above by Dick Guindon. Here I document my noteworthy explorations with topics of interest as simply as possible. In particular, over the past couple years I've been mainly interested in:
- Linux systems administration and computer networking
- Differential geometry and Lie theory (specifically its applications to general relativity and particle physics)
- Embedded systems, PCB design and board bring-up

I am also skilled in computer programming for wide array of applications. Including Typescript and .NET for web development, Python for scripting, C for embedded systems and Lisp for functional programming. 

Day to day, I am currently working as a data engineer. Before that I worked as web developer building enterprise web applications. Education wise I hold Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cape Town. My thesis described an experiment I designed to characterize the susceptibility of Single Event Upsets on a custom optical transceiver for the ATLAS II upgrade at CERN.
