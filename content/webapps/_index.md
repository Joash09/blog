Welcome! Herein lies various projects I have completed. They are a mix of webapps highlighting topics in computer science, custom PCB designs and 3D CAD models. 

For those interested, the webapps were embedded using [Lit](https://lit.dev/) Web Components. Custom PCBs are designed with the open source [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) software, and similarly the 3D CAD models are done with the open source [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) software.
