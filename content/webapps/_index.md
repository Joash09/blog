There are two approaches which work for me when learning a topic. One is to try explain it, which justifies my blog. The other is to build something, which is why I am keeping a collection of things I have built here. Choose a webapp from the left to get started.

These webapps were built using [Lit](https://lit.dev/) Web Components and simply embedded into this Hugo static site.
